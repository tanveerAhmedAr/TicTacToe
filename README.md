# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

## Game Logic

- The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of buttons.
- A player's turn is determined by a boolean variable (`turn0`), alternating between O and X.
- Moves are recorded and checked against predefined winning patterns.
- If a winning pattern is found, the game announces the winner.
- If all spaces are filled without a winner, it is declared a draw.
- Buttons are disabled after selection to prevent overwriting.
